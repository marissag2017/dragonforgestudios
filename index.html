            <p>Go on adventures and solve mysteries while you make choices, allies, and enemies in our upcoming game, "Wizard and The Dead King".</p>
            <p>In this RPG, you'll delve into themes of loss and self-discovery as you follow the journey of a shapeshifter known only as Wizard, ostracized for her inability to shapeshift into anything but a small red fox. Alone and seeking her place, she encounters a half buried talking skull, a long-lost king missing his crown. Together, Wizard and Skull King embark on a quest through many different terrains, forming an unlikely friendship as they unravel the mysteries of identity and reclaim what's been lost. Can they overcome challenges and find purpose in their intertwined destinies?</p>
